Google is now a licensed mortgage broker. The tech giant launched Google Compare for mortgages on Monday that will allow potential home buyers to find and compare home loans. When looking to buy a home, experts recommend shopping around to find the best mortgage terms. With Google Compare, users will be able to enter personal information, including property value, down payment size and approximate credit score to get tailored results. The results will also show lenders' ratings and reviews. Homeowners can also use the tool to refinance their mortgages.
