By carpediem4"' on November "4, "0"5 0':"0 am "'" Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share Let's stop pretending that it isn't a problem.Ever since iOS ", Apple's software Quality Assurance has been disastrous.iOS has been riddled with countless design inconsistencies and sloppiness, performance issues and frame drops than it has ever been. It's appalling.Marco was absolutely right when he wrote "Apple has lost the functional high ground".And has it gotten any better after " year and a half, with the latest iPhones packing the "most advanced chip ever in a smartphone"?Chris Pirillo says no. Hell no.There's simply no excuse for a company who spends ""5 hours on a single watch face for the Apple Watch.It doesn't make sense to argue that it's a "minor issue" for a company who cares about the sound a mouse makes when it glides over the surface.Dear Apple, I don't care about the authenticity of a blooming flower on a watch face or the gliding sound of a mouse. I want my devices to just work flawlessly. I mean, isn't that why we use iOS?I really really hope Apple does whatever it can to get back to its renowned level of software quality. Maybe they can call Scott Forstall back or something.
