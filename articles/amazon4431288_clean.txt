But since then the world has started to catch up, and -- as we heard at WIRED Retail "0"5 -- delivery by drone, rolling robot and self-driving car seem more real every day.To mark its progress, and also to gain a little bit of extra PR on the day of an online shopping bonanza traditionally known as 'Cyber Monday' Amazon has given a new glimpse at its Prime Air service.The company said it still sees "great potential" in drones, which could provide "rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system".
